# -------------
# User Instructions
#
# Here you will be implementing a cyclic smoothing
# algorithm. This algorithm should not fix the end
# points (as you did in the unit quizzes). You  
# should use the gradient descent equations that
# you used previously.
#
# Your function should return the newpath that it
# calculates..
#
# Feel free to use the provided solution_check function
# to test your code. You can find it at the bottom.
#
# --------------
# Testing Instructions
# 
# To test your code, call the solution_check function with
# two arguments. The first argument should be the result of your
# smooth function. The second should be the corresponding answer.
# For example, calling
#
# solution_check(smooth(testpath1), answer1)
#
# should return True if your answer is correct and False if
# it is not.

# Do not modify path inside your function.
