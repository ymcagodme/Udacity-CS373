# -------------
# User Instructions
#
# Now you will be incorporating fixed points into
# your smoother. 
#
# You will need to use the equations from gradient
# descent AND the new equations presented in the
# previous lecture to implement smoothing with
# fixed points.
#
# Your function should return the newpath that it
# calculates. 
#
# Feel free to use the provided solution_check function
# to test your code. You can find it at the bottom.
#
# --------------
# Testing Instructions
# 
# To test your code, call the solution_check function with
# two arguments. The first argument should be the result of your
# smooth function. The second should be the corresponding answer.
# For example, calling
#
# solution_check(smooth(testpath1), answer1)
#
# should return True if your answer is correct and False if
# it is not.
